# Brain_Tumor_Segmentation
Project: Real time GPU-Accelerated 3D Vision Transformer for Brain Tumor Segmentation

1. Visualize the BraTs data to first understand what the data looks like - view_interactive_4pane_brats.py
2. Preprocess the data - preprocessor.py
3. Build a baseline 3D U-Net model (CNN) and grab baseline measurements
4. Build a transformer-based 3D segmentation model (UNETR or SwinUNETR) and compare with U-Net
5. Optimize components with GPU & grab performance improvements
